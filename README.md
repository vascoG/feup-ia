  In order to play the game, you need to use a Prolog system. We recommend SICStus Prolog (v4.7) because it's the environment in which it was developed.

  In that system, you can load game.pl in 'File -> Consult -> game.pl'.
  
  Then, you can either play it using the predicate 'play.' where you can select the Option (Human x Human, Human x Computer or watch a Computer x Computer game) and the Computer level if present. You can also test the levels of the Computer using the predicate 'test(+L1,+L2).', where the Computer with L1 will play 50 games with the Computer with L2 (L1 and L2 need to be chosen by the user).
